The purpose of this brand is sustanability, socially and environmentally.

## Code structure

The initial code was developed by the founder with art created by himself and a certain BV Cooper. I was tasked with heavy refacoring due to modern web development conventions in order to create a greater responsive design and also a filestructure that promotes readability. The HTML was also laregely reworked in order to have greater leverage of Css classnames rather than reliance on IDs.
